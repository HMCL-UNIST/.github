## High-assurance Mobility Control Lab @ UNIST Ulsan

**We care about safety-critical mobile Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS).** We are interested in the mechatronic design and control of systems that autonomously adapt to different situations and cope with our uncertain and dynamic daily environment. We are fascinated by novel robot concepts that are best adapted for acting on the ground, in the air and in the water. We are furthermore keen to give them the intelligence to autonomously navigate in challenging environments. This includes novel methods and tools for perception, abstraction, mapping and path planning.
